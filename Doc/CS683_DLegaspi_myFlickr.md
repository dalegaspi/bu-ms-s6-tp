## Overview

I have been an avid photographer since I was in high school when my mother purchased my first Pentax SLR.  The advent of digital technology lending itself to the advancement of photography has further helped on improving my craft since I also work in the computer field.  There are a million applications (desktop and mobile alike) for photography and I have benefitted from most of them, and I would like to pay it forward with a contribution of my own for anyone who wants to improve in their craft.

Flickr is one of the first established and popular photography websites, and have been instrumental with my learning finding images of other people around the world.  Flickr is a photography website, but it is more geared towards the social aspects of it: followers, groups and sharing of images.  These are important, but it is equally important to look at one's own catalog without the noise, and see how he/she has improved.  This is the focus the app: hence the name "myFlickr":  to focus on **my** images and have a fresh perspective on them.  It would have the usual images viewer but the browser would be more optimized for quick browsing with the metadata (which the official app doesn't do today); there will be minimal features geared towards the social/sharing and more tools to filter and inspect your own images--e.g., there will be search and filtering based on the metadata of the images

## Building the project

The project uses Gradle, and issuing the `gradle build` command should suffice in building the app.  However, prior to building the application, it will require to have the Flickr API key in the `local.properties` file:  

```properties
flickr.api.key=$YOUR_API_KEY
flickr.api.secret=$YOUR_SECRET_KEY
```

## Related Work

### Essential 
 
The essential features of the application will revolve around being able to authenticate and retrieve the images of the authenticated user.  The authentication requires interfacing with a relatively antiquated OAuth 1.0a authentication scheme of the Flickr API.  In addition, the core functionaly, of course, is to be able to show all the images of the user, either in individual mode or in a grid.  When viewing the individual image, the user should be able to optionally see the overlay of the image metadata.

### Desirable

With regards to the image viewing and presentation, it would be desirable to have as much options as possible: it would be nice to have a split view of the images where one can have a film strip view of the images on the bottom half and then the selected image on the top and also be able to optionally group the images based on the metadata.

### Optional

It would be nice to have some push notifications for any likes or increased views but it will be very low on the totem pole of features to be implemented and will only be there time permitting.

## Design and Implementation

### Basic Architecture

The application will (likely) follow the traditional [Model-View-View-Model Design Pattern](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mvvm-model-view-viewmodel-architecture-pattern-in-android/) and will be relying on [Dependency Injection](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection) to minimize coupling of components.

### UI Design and Implementation  
 
 The UI design will be very minimal; it will try to mimic looking at a photo lightbox as much as possible.  There will be menu that will be out of the way most of the time to maximize the screen real estate for viewing the images.

### Third-Party APIs

As mentioned, we are going to leverage a lot of the Flickr API and this will be made possible by using third party libraries like [Flickr4Java](https://github.com/boncey/Flickr4Java) and [ScribeJava](https://github.com/scribejava/scribejava).  We are also going to leverage the use of HTTP/REST libraries like [OkHttp](https://square.github.io/okhttp/).  We will try to incorporate [Dagger](https://github.com/google/dagger) which simplifies automatic dependency injection without putting a lot of overhead.

### Data Design and Implementation

A lot of the data will come via the Flickr API and will certainly leverage the available methods to get the images and metadata and it search aspects.  The rest will be using a local database (SQLite) for more efficient filtering of metadata.

## Project Structure

This is the initial directory structure of the project.  It only has the basic classes and artifacts that are generated using Android Studio IDE.  The Gradle script has been modified to add Third Party License references and Spotless plugin.

## Lessons Learned and Other Notes

### Iteration 0
- OAuth 1.0a integration is difficult nowadays because most implementations are in 2.x.  Unfortunately, Flickr API is using 1.x   
- I learned that Since Android 3, apps cannot execute network-related tasks in the UI thread, which prompted me to having to learn about `AsyncTask` (which apparently has been recently deprecated) to geth the OAuth integration to work.    

### Iteration 1
- Per my facilitator's feedback, I removed the API key/secret in the code and instead leveraged having them as part of the local.properties file so that they are injected at buildtime via the auto-generated `BuildConfig` class.
- The current way of saving state right now is very rudimentary but mimics the way Lab 2 had done it: via the static component of a data class.  This of course will change in future iteration as I learn more in the coming weeks.
- Right now there are 2 activities: MainActivity and ImageActivity.  The way the user information (user ID) is passed between the two activities using `intent.putExtra`
- I was compelled to introduce the use of Adapters (`PhotosAdapter`) to build the initial grid of images that uses RecyclerView.  This was further made complicated by the fact there is no trivial way to call `getViewById` in an Adapter.  Fortunately, I have found an alternate way using [View Binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding#setup).
- Layouts has continued to eat up the most time on development.  While the image grid is working, the gaps between rows are huge and I have yet to find out why that is and how to reduce it.


### Iteration 2
- Per my facilitator's feedback, the application now displays a different fragment on the main activity in an event of API keys not set up correctly (or any API integration errors for that matter) and have a button that allows exiting the app gracefully and not just crash:

```kotlin
binding.textErrorString.text = "Unable to authenticate with Flickr due to API authentication errors (probably Invalid API keys)."

binding.exitApplicationButton.setOnClickListener {
  activity?.finish()
}
```

- The application now takes full advantage of fragments and view bindings.  Lab 3 has been _instrumental_ in understanding how it all works and was able to apply the knowledge for this iteration.
- Layouts still a challenge although it's a bit manageable than before.


### Iteration 3

- Added more comments in the code per facilitator's feedback 
- Much research is done on the library to be used for the charts/statistics.  The data are mostly not wired yet but should provide some clues on what the final will look like
- I learned that in Android there is the AppBar, ActionBar, and ToolBar and MaterialDesign has design guidance for all three.  It's confusing and seem convoluted.  Some significant work is done on the auto-hiding Toolbar.  Most of the information out there are outdated and the recent AndroidX Framework actually made this very easy now, it's just a matter of finding the information
- Right now the image stats are downloaded from the Flickr API and stored in the database but it blocks.  Future iteration should not block this to make the UI responsive
- Lab3 has been helpful in understanding the database integration beyond concepts and was able to apply those knowledge here.
- Note that the db entries _are_ real data but they are not wired to the UI yet.
- The only thing working on the Options right now is the (Show as Grid)
- The stats are using placeholder (aka fake) data
